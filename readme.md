# Welcome to the PCFG Password Research Project

PCFG = Probabilistic Context Free Grammar
PCFG = Pretty Cool Fuzzy Guesser

In short: A collection of tools to perform research into how humans generate passwords. These can be used to crack password hashes, but also create synthetic passwords (honeywords), or help develop better password stength algorithms
